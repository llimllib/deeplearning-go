The code in here is derived from the code in [this book](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-and-the-game-of-go), which has an accompanying [repo here](https://github.com/maxpumperla/deep_learning_and_the_game_of_go).

That repo doesn't have a license, and I'm not sure what the license of the code in the book is, so you should probably consider all of this code as all rights reserved. I hate licenses, I hate lack of clear licensing even more, but what can you do.
